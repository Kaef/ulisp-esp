# ESP32 sleep functions

## Sleep functions (developed in brach 'dev-deepsleep', merged back to master (2018-11-26))

Because ESP32 has many wakeup possibilities which can be combined I decided to
add separate functions to activate the wakeup-sources, similar to the
Espressif idf-framework (not all idf-functions are supported).
  ```
  (enable-timer-wakeup 60)
  (enable-ext0-wakeup 0 0)
  (deepsleep-start)
  ```
  This sequence sets esp32 in deepsleep-mode. It will wakeup after 60 seconds or if GPIO0 is pulled to GND.
  You can use (get-reset-reason) and (get-sleep-wakeup-cause) to find out how the board is waked up.

### At time of writing (April 2019) uLisp now supports the following sleep and wakeup functions:

* (enable-timer-wakeup secs)

  secs can be a positive integer or float value
  ```
  (enable-timer-wakeup 10)
  or: (enable-timer-wakeup 20.5)
  ```
  will configure the timer-wakeup 10 (20.5) seconds after entering sleep-mode. To enter deepsleep-mode you need to call
  (deep-sleep-start).
  Returns wakeup-time or throughs an error (non integer or negativ parameter).
  
* (deep-sleep-start)

  Sets the system to deepsleep mode (see Espressif-documentation for details) with the
  previous set wakeup-mode(s). It is important to set at least one wakeup-mode before calling this function,
  otherwise the command abords with an error message ("Please configure wakeup-mode(s) first!").

  If sdcardsupport is defined, the function needs ~200ms to close open files (caused by a delay() to enable flushing buffers).
  
  When the system restarts, you may need to check (reset-reason) and/or (get-sleep-wakeup-cause) to decide if the system
  restarts due a power cycle or due sleep-wakeup. For detailed information of the wakeup-cause see
  (reset-reason) and (get-sleep-wakeup-cause) below.
  The system-restart takes some seconds and ulisp boots completely (all informations from before deep-sleeping
  will be lost!). To continue with your ulisp program you need to use (save-image 'function) or
  the LispLibrary-function to load and start your code.

* (isolate-gpioGPIO_NUM)

  To reduce the current consumption in sleep-modes you can isolate the gpios which have external
  pullup- or pulldown-resistors. If using the ESP32-WROVER module you can come down to 6ÂµA current draw in deep-sleep-mode!
  
  I'm not sure wheather it's a good idea to isolate GPIOs which are configured for wakeup (but it seems to work correctly).
  ```
  (isolate-gpio 25)
  ```
  GPIOs allowed to isolate are: 0..5, 12-33
  (because 6..11 are used for SPI-flash, 34..39 has no built-in pullup or pulldown resistor so there's no need to isolate them)

  see Espressif documentation of rtc_gpio_isolate() for details.

  Returns GPIO-num on success or nil if GPIO_NUM can't be isolated.

  
* enable-ext0-wakeup(GPIO_NUM, LEVEL)

  Use a GPIO to wakeup the system. Allowed GPIOs are: 0, 2, 4, 12..15, 25..27, 32..39 (see Espressif documentation).
  LEVEL must be 0 or 1.
  ```
  (enable-ext0-wakeup 0 0)
  ```
  This enables a LOW signal on GPIO0 to wakeup the system. Call (deepsleep-start) to enter deepsleep mode.

  Returns: list of given arguments on success, error-message if it fails.

* get-sleep-wakeup-cause()

  Returns the sleep-wakup-cause, see Espressif-documentation for details.

  Here are some values I saw on my system: 0: no sleep wakeup (maybe normal boot), 1: ext0 sleep wakeup, 3: timer wakeup
       
* enable-gpio-wakeup(GPIO_NUM, LEVEL) (**light sleep only**)

  Configure any gpio (same GPIOs as for enable-ext0-wakeup possible) to wakeup the system after lightsleep.
  LEVEL must be 0 or 1.

  **WARNING: arduino-esp32-idf V. 1.0.1 is needed!**
  ```
  (enable-gpio-wakeup 0 0)
  ```

* lightsleep-start()

  Sets the system to lightsleep mode. A wakeup must be enabled before calling this function, otherwise an error will be shown.

  In contrast to deepsleep lightsleep will **not reboot** the system, but continue with the next instruction after wakeup.
  Therefore lightsleep works somewhat similar to delay, but some system components are powered off (see Espressif-documentation for details).
  
At time of writing this document there's no support for other sleep functions:
* disable-wakeup-source(source)
* enable-uart-wakeup(num_chars)
* enable-ext1-wakeup
* get-ext1-wakeup-status
* enable-touchpad-wakeup
* get-touchpad-wakeup-status
* sleep-pd-config(...)
